# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
What are the methods and the property of the shark class? 
 The shark class provides a blueprint for the code when it's going to be written

What is the purpose of a constructor? 
 To be automatically initialized, so one doesn't need to call it.

What is a class vs. an object and what does it mean to "instantiate an object from a class?" 
 A class is a blueprint for a variable, while the object is the instance of the class. The class is usually at the start of the code whereas after it's defined it is brought up as an object later in the code. Instantiateing an object from a class means to make it an instance, to manifest it from the blueprint held at the beginning.
 
 ## Create Shark Class thing
 
 # Unified Modeling Language (UML)
 
 Define OMG and describe the purpose of UML 
 UML is designed to make visual system for models that can be understood no matter the scenario.

Reflecting back to your shark program, match each of the following terms: 
 
object, class, abstraction, encapsulation and inheritance  
 
to: swim(self), shark, a specific type of shark, definition of a shark, Sammy 
 
and explain why you matched the terms as you did (under the Unified Modeling Language (UML)heading)
## Do number 2 also


# Data, Information and Knowledge 
If you were creating a database for a small company and two tables you identify are customers and orders explain the following (under the Data heading): 

What would be the primary key in the customers and orders table? 
 Customers would be assigned a number (ID) to track which customer is which. Orders would have unique code as well to identify their completion. 

How would the customers and orders table be related? 
 The binding factor of the customer and their completed order would be the item itself, which is paired to the customer's name and paired to the completed order code.

What would be the foreign key in the orders table?
The item code would be the foreign key.

The orders table would likely have a date field.Â  Explain why it is important to properly define the data type of a field.
Keeping things chronological helps with accounting.


## Relational Data

What is the difference between data, information and knowledge? 
Data is the facts in their purest form, either in calculation (Quantitative) or in description/opinion (Qualitative).
Information is data that has context, relevance and purpose.
Knowledge is the relationships among acts or concepts relevant to a specific area.

## Big Data
 
Briefly describe the four "Vs" of big data 
Volume: The amount of data.
Velocity: how fresh the data is.
Variety: the different types of data and data resources.
Veracity: Trustworthiness of the data.

What types of technology have driven the increased need for big data?
Social Media, Facial Recognition, Text to Speech, AI for example.

#  Structured Query Language 


Explain RDBMS and how it relates to SQL and the purpose of SQL:

 Relational Database Management System is the basis for all modern database systems, Standard Query Language (SQL) included.
SQL is used for work within databases.

Pick two related tables from the diagram above and explain the relationship between them including which is the primary key, 
foreign key and the meaning of the relationship between the tables:
Table 1-Customers
The primary key is the customer ID as that makes each row of the table the most unique.
Table 2-Suppliers
The primary key is the Supplier ID as it keeps the list most unique.
The Foreign Key would be the Country or City (they share information on geographic residence), which would link which supplier is more efficient for the customer.

Explain how SQL injections are a security threat and what can be done to reduce the issue.
As SQL is standard, it is very simple to hack into and retreive sensitive information. Adding @ signs to make parameters helps combat this.
