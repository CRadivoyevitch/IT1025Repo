# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
What are the methods and the property of the shark class? 
 The shark class provides a blueprint for the code when it's going to be written

What is the purpose of a constructor? 
 To be automatically initialized, so one doesn't need to call it.

What is a class vs. an object and what does it mean to "instantiate an object from a class?" 
 A class is a blueprint for a variable, while the object is the instance of the class. The class is usually at the start of the code whereas after it's defined it is brought up as an object later in the code. Instantiateing an object from a class means to make it an instance, to manifest it from the blueprint held at the beginning.
 
 
 # Unified Modeling Language (UML)

Define OMG and describe the purpose of UML 
 the Object Management Group is an open membership standards consortium to develop enterprise standards. 
UML provides the engineers and developers of the computer world with tools to design analyze and model their work. It also helps with vizualization.

Reflecting back to your shark program, match each of the following terms: 
 
-object:Sammy (Was an object in the example)-
-class:shark (This is the Shark Class)-
-abstraction:definition of a shark (explains it's behavior)-
-encapsulation: swim(self) (takes the code and makes it compact)-
-inheritance: a specific type of shark (new class is made)-


# Data, Information and Knowledge 
If you were creating a database for a small company and two tables you identify are customers and orders explain the following (under the Data heading): 

What would be the primary key in the customers and orders table? 
 Customers would be assigned a number (ID) to track which customer is which. Orders would have unique code as well to identify their completion. 

How would the customers and orders table be related? 
 The binding factor of the customer and their completed order would be the item itself, which is paired to the customer's name and paired to the completed order code.

What would be the foreign key in the orders table?
The item code would be the foreign key.

The orders table would likely have a date field.Â  Explain why it is important to properly define the data type of a field.
Keeping things chronological helps with accounting.


## Relational Data

What is the difference between data, information and knowledge? 
Data is the facts in their purest form, either in calculation (Quantitative) or in description/opinion (Qualitative).
Information is data that has context, relevance and purpose.
Knowledge is the relationships among acts or concepts relevant to a specific area.

## Big Data
 
Briefly describe the four "Vs" of big data 
Volume: The amount of data.
Velocity: how fresh the data is.
Variety: the different types of data and data resources.
Veracity: Trustworthiness of the data.

What types of technology have driven the increased need for big data?
Social Media, Facial Recognition, Text to Speech, AI for example.

#  Structured Query Language 


Explain RDBMS and how it relates to SQL and the purpose of SQL:

 Relational Database Management System is the basis for all modern database systems, Standard Query Language (SQL) included.
SQL is used for work within databases.

Pick two related tables from the diagram above and explain the relationship between them including which is the primary key, 
foreign key and the meaning of the relationship between the tables:
Table 1-Customers
The primary key is the customer ID as that makes each row of the table the most unique.
Table 2-Suppliers
The primary key is the Supplier ID as it keeps the list most unique.
The Foreign Key would be the Country or City (they share information on geographic residence), which would link which supplier is more efficient for the customer.

Explain how SQL injections are a security threat and what can be done to reduce the issue.
As SQL is standard, it is very simple to hack into and retreive sensitive information. Adding @ signs to make parameters helps combat this.
 

# Ethical and Legal Implications 


## Code of Ethics

Explain the purpose of a "code of ethics" and why the ACM created a code for the computing discipline. 
 A code of ethics keeps order and morales to an environment. Computing is like the wild west; there is still much grey area on as to what is legal or not. 
Having a code for the computing discipline keeps likened minds, and sets a standard for what direction users should use their talents.

Explain the difference between a code of ethics and AUP (acceptable use policies.) 
 AUPs are for private services, like Starbucks WiFi.

Pick a site of your choice and read the AUP.  Select a policy of interest and report your findings (include a link to the site in your report.) 
 https://www.runescape.com/game-guide/rules
 This is to a video game 'RuneScape'. One of the policies is a lack of third-party software. I find this interesting as they may cause the game to be
easily exploited, but also allow for a refreshing experience as one can plug in and out of their different software.

## Intellectual Property 

What is the purpose and importance of the WIPO? 
 The WIPO keeps up on the regulations and policies of Intellectual Property. With different laws for different areas
it is much easier to have a global organization keeping ordeals in check.

Using links in the chapter explain how a copyright is obtained and the benefit of registering for a copyright with the US Copyright Office. Explain why it might be important to copyright the svg image you created. 
 A copyright in most cases is obtained as soon as the artist creates their work. In Registering it, the copyright is now documented and will hold up better in court, as well as 
Provide others the knowledge that that idea is taken. Copywriting the svg image means the true original has been copywritten, which again helps for legal
issues as there is more proof for your case.

If the svg image you created became an item that identifies a source of goods or services, explain the role of a trademark in defining the intellectual property. 
Trademarks will decide on what types of goods or services the copyright can be used on. It is needed if the copyright is to be used without being stolen.

## Information Collection
Explain how COPPA, FERPA, and HIPPA restrict the collection of information on the internet.
HIPPA-Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act gives parent's rights to student information, and he information school health services can share.
COPPA- Children's Online Privacy Protection Act prevents collection of online data from persons under 13 years of age
FERPA- Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. Prevents disclousure of infformation on grades or behaviour to anyone not the student or parent.

These are in place to keep our minors safe.

# Conclusion
The content discussed certainly gives a great front of resources that one can use to propel themselves into whatever field of computing they are interested in, and help others perhaps discover what parts of computing they actually hold an interest to. On top of this understanding a basic skeletal of how the network is standardized really aids in creating the proper mindset for future classes.
