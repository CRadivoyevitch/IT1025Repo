## Raster Vs. Vector Graphics
a Raster image is one where the pixels are small enough to the eye that they are only noticed when zoomed in. Vector images use geometric equations when rendered so that quality isn't sacrificed no matter what size the image is. A raster is best for pictures of reality, whereas vector images are more to the realm of graphic design.

## Lossless vs Lossy Compression
as a Lossy compression preserves space, a developer would utilize it when there is a limited amount of space, such as on a CD. Lossless images are useful when presenting the main images of an area or when space is not an issuing factor.

## File Format
Gifs provide frame by frame changes in pictures, giving fluidity to the image as it moves through the slideshow. JPEGs use Lossy compression which the user can determine how much or little is lost, and a PNG uses Lossless compression, meaning larger files but better quality image.

## File Properties
Five layers were required for this, and the image is 893 KB in size. It can be opened with Windows Paint, Photo, and paint 3D.Opening with Windows Paint is wiser, as the logo should be ready to be edited at any time.

# LucidChart
The platform is easy to use and a great way to visually represent a program one is trying to portray. I will be looking forward to using it in the future.
