# Python IDLE
Explain the difference between the shell and file editor in the IDLE
The shell provides immediate reaction to a coded action, whereas the file editor allows for work on fully programmed codes.
## Code Examples

A variable is a phrase or unit that equates to something else, be it a number or entire code itself. This allows for ease of writing the code especially when long. Spam, bacon and eggs is used as generic variables. It is an easter egg for a Monty Python sketch.
MyAge=44. MyAge is the variable
An assignment statement is the code with the variable, equals sign, and the code that the variable will represent
MyAge=44 is the entire assignment statement
A function is a foundation of code that allows for the basis of programming in the language.
print() and input() are examples

the three data types are integers, floating-point numbers, and strings.
integers: 453666
Floating-point numbers: 3.445
string: 'My name is'

# Graphics

## Raster Vs. Vector Graphics
a Raster image is one where the pixels are small enough to the eye that they are only noticed when zoomed in. Vector images use geometric equations when rendered so that quality isn't sacrificed no matter what size the image is. A raster is best for pictures of reality, whereas vector images are more to the realm of graphic design.

## Lossless vs Lossy Compression
as a Lossy compression preserves space, a developer would utilize it when there is a limited amount of space, such as on a CD. Lossless images are useful when presenting the main images of an area or when space is not an issuing factor.

## File Format
Gifs provide frame by frame changes in pictures, giving fluidity to the image as it moves through the slideshow. JPEGs use Lossy compression which the user can determine how much or little is lost, and a PNG uses Lossless compression, meaning larger files but better quality image.

## File Properties
Five layers were required for this, and the image is 893 KB in size. It can be opened with Windows Paint, Photo, and paint 3D.Opening with Windows Paint is wiser, as the logo should be ready to be edited at any time.

# LucidChart
The platform is easy to use and a great way to visually represent a program one is trying to portray. I will be looking forward to using it in the future.

# Introduction to Networking

## Data Transmission

Definitions to match:  
Protocol: Set of rules to allow devices to communicate 
Packet: Unit of data 
IP Address: Unique identifying number 
Packet-Switching: Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address 
DNS: Directory of IP address common names.  For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com

All terms are used when performing activity on the internet.

## Networking Hardware

Explain the benefit of a switch over a hub. 
While both receive data, a Hub receives data and sends it to all outputs, whereas a switch can send the data to a specific port, thus saving bandwidth.
Explain the benefit of a router over hubs and switches. 
A router reads IP addresses, allowing for activity outside the local network (hubs and switches are built for local networks)
## Network Topologies

Explain: Single point of failure and the topologies that experience this issue. 
This is when a failure of a central hub fails on a wired topology, such as a Star Topology, the entire system will fail.

Compare the Infrastructure Topology and Wireless Mesh. Which do you think is better and why?
Wirelss Mesh topology allows for largescale communication and less hassle of wires. However it creates an opportunity for unwanted devices to have access to the network. If a business is handling sensitive information, a wired mesh is the wiser option.

## Network Design
What I made was a simple Wireless Mesh, where devices are connected to the WAP allowing for connectivity to one another.

## NSA/CCS
These agencies are focused towards network and data security in America, and monitor activity to catch anything suspicious. They also work to create and decrypt codes.
