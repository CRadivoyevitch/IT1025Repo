# Executive Summary  
Lab 1 of IT-1025 is composed of a breath into the foundations of github, as well as the foundations of how networking technology has advanced the technological world over the last century. It is odd yet incredible that the United States held the birthplace and major benchmarks of the internet. With the two major powers of the world being the USA and the USSR in the heat of a Cold War, the growth of the internet would seem to be almost more of an accomplishment than landing on the moon. One could gander that it was the capitalism of America that allowed this technology to leave the universities and military bases and enter the consumer world, a feat that would have been far too costly for the USSR to commit to on top of space exploration.

# Information System Components  
Being stuck in the house with 3 little brothers can cause arguments. It can also be the perfect time to play video games as many allow up to 4-players to play. Our Nintendo Switch is a valuable piece of hardware, as it is a tablet, a game console, and encourages local multiplayer. The Software harnesses the coding of games of course, but also provides access to an online shop, Youtube and Hulu, and online multiplayer. With a username and friend code, the surface level of it's social aspects comes into play. When looking deeper, one will notice that the stores are region locked, credit card information is stored, and countless other data is certainly mined and stored. As the community grows, more data can be obtained, more capital is obtained, and all allow for better games in the future.

# GitHub  
## Client-Server Architecture  
On the client-end, communication and the evolution of coding advances is allowed as we users post our projects and learn from the projects of others. The server-side works to store the data and keep things running smoothly AND securely. If users are content with the site's performance and it's web-security, they will be more likely to contribute more to the site. GitHub Desktop helps bridge the gap between Mac and PC users, simplifying the interfaces, and adding more harmony to the server and user sides.

##  Cloud Computing 
 Being able to access a project from different platforms is the prime reason that GitHub is considered cloud-computing. Many platforms work as such, keeping the user's data on their own servers to allow for access anywhere. Examples include G-mail, Twitter, and Youtube.

# Conclusion  
It is reasurring that having correct spelling when writing this was my biggest challenge in the lesson. The history of networking is interesting on the surface and becomes mindblowing the deeper one digs. I'm looking forward to what trains of thought will be engineered as these next 5 weeks reach full force.
