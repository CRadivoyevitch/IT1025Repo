# Executive Summary  
Lab 1 of IT-1025 is composed of a breath into the foundations of github, as well as the foundations of how networking technology has advanced the technological world over the last century. It is odd yet incredible that the United States held the birthplace and major benchmarks of the internet. With the two major powers of the world being the USA and the USSR in the heat of a Cold War, the growth of the internet would seem to be almost more of an accomplishment than landing on the moon. One could gander that it was the capitalism of America that allowed this technology to leave the universities and military bases and enter the consumer world, a feat that would have been far too costly for the USSR to commit to on top of space exploration.

# Information System Components  
Being stuck in the house with 3 little brothers can cause arguments. It can also be the perfect time to play video games as many allow up to 4-players to play. Our Nintendo Switch is a valuable piece of hardware, as it is a tablet, a game console, and encourages local multiplayer. The Software harnesses the coding of games of course, but also provides access to an online shop, Youtube and Hulu, and online multiplayer. With a username and friend code, the surface level of it's social aspects comes into play. When looking deeper, one will notice that the stores are region locked, credit card information is stored, and countless other data is certainly mined and stored. As the community grows, more data can be obtained, more capital is obtained, and all allow for better games in the future.

# GitHub  
## Client-Server Architecture  
On the client-end, communication and the evolution of coding advances is allowed as we users post our projects and learn from the projects of others. The server-side works to store the data and keep things running smoothly AND securely. If users are content with the site's performance and it's web-security, they will be more likely to contribute more to the site. GitHub Desktop helps bridge the gap between Mac and PC users, simplifying the interfaces, and adding more harmony to the server and user sides.

##  Cloud Computing 
 Being able to access a project from different platforms is the prime reason that GitHub is considered cloud-computing. Many platforms work as such, keeping the user's data on their own servers to allow for access anywhere. Examples include G-mail, Twitter, and Youtube.

# Hardware
Latency is the time it takes to find a data on the hard drive, whereas transfer rates are in regards to the importing and exporting of that data from the hard drive.
Solid State Drives bypass much of this by having no moving parts, instead operating like RAM where it stores data that is immediately obtainable. SSDs are more expensive than HDDs but are lowering costs as technology progresses.

RAM is the medium between the Hard Drive and CPU's communication. With more RAM, more data can be taken off the Hard Drive at a given time and moved to the CPU without backlog.
64 and 32 bit referrs to the amount of data bits that is moved in one clock cycle, with 64 being the superior but more demanding choice.

## ALU and the Control Unit
When a command is sent to the Control Unit, it is then sent to the Arithmetic Logic Unit where the calculations take place. results are sent back to the Control Unit when needed

## CPU Input and Output
Input takes information from outside (microphone sounds, keyboard presses, etc.) the CPU and converts it to binary, which the CPU interprets and then sends out as an output (a screen, speaker, machine)
## Logic Gates and Circuits
Truth Tables use logic to determine reactions to data, creating a binary output of either a 1 or 0 depending on the gate being used. an AND gate declares that if one input holds true then the output will be 1, whereas the NAND states any (1) input will create an output of 0. Per an article on ElectronicsTutorials.com the NAND gate is powerul in that it is able to create the AND, Or, NOT gates when utilized correctly.

## IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design 
With great power comes great responsibility, and the internet/computing may be the greatest power humanity has discovered thus far. abiding by a code of ethics is the difference between profiting off of other's hard work or collaborating with them, or creating a device that can harm lives or benefits them.

# Conclusion  
It is reasurring that having correct spelling when writing this was my biggest challenge in the lesson. The history of networking is interesting on the surface and becomes mindblowing the deeper one digs. I'm looking forward to what trains of thought will be engineered as these next 5 weeks reach full force.
